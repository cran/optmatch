To wishlist of methods for pcscore.dist, add objects from gbm package.  See email of today from sguo@email.unc.edu

Following code crashed pscore.dist/makedist:
> pm2.low <- glm(update.formula(pscore.fmla, .~.*I(si.q1<=10)), [...]
> pd2.low <- pscore.dist(pm2.low, structure.fmla=~I(si.q1 <= 10))
(Cf anniAdmissions/stage1/match2007-08-24.Rnw)

Issue is that the model frame of pm2.low doesn't have v-ble 'si.q1',
rather 'I(si.qi <= 10)'.  Maybe pscore.dist should have an optional
data argument, just for evaluating structure.fmla?

2007-08-24 Chris Johnson tried to combine pscore.dist() with Harrell's
lrm() function, from Design package.  No go, b/c lrm() objects don't
have same value info as glm() objects.  Maybe pscore.dist should really
have methods for different kinds of fitted propensity models? (See also 2008-03-21 note)

For future help page/howto regarding makedist():
A likely source of errors in writing a function to be called in
makedist() are errors due to coercion of 1xn or nx1 matrices to
vectors.  outer() helpfully gives you a matrix rather than a vector in
this case, but then if you operate on that matrix it tends to get
coerced to a vector.

Maybe makedist() should accept as argument a
distance-making function with 1st and second args Tnms and Cnms.  Can
this readily be done?  Maybe try it with a new function name, since I
now seem to have a working makedist().

Test makedist().  Some tests: formula with null RHS; non-binary LHS, expression on LHS

Consider adding refs to Harrell's matching functions find.matches and
matchCases.

Introduce omit.controls arguments to max.control.cap, min.control.cap.
Next step is to set it up to handle negative values of omit.controls
cap.  I seem to recall doing a bit of testing of omit.controls option
(in summer 2004).
