	* Modified interpretation of tol to prevent slowdown on large problems.
2005-10-03
	* Tweaked maxControlsCap in order to get it to handle distance
	matrices of dimension 1xn or nx1 w/0 dropping their dimensions.
2005-09-08
	* Added some detail to error message in fullmatch() for it is
	given lists that fail to be matrices.  The hope is that this will
	be helpful to people in funny situations that can arise when they
	have been manipulating lists containing a few "matrices" of
	dimension 0xn or nxO, as arises when a subclass contains only
	treatments or only controls.  fullmatch handles matrices like that
	the way it should, but it's easy to inadvertently coerce such a
	matrix to a vector of length 0 without a dim attribute. 
2005-09-08
	* Modified beginnings of fullmatch(), maxControlsCap() to remove
	NULL entries from lists of distances.
2005-03-15
	* Created summary method for optmatch objects: reports bound on
	discrepancy between match and optimal match, then calls
	summary.factor
	* Modified print.optmatch, removing report of bound on
	discrepancy between match and optimal match and setting up for
	printing more like that of print.factor (but without giving a
	list of levels separately)
	* Fixed example in matched.Rd
	* Modified fullmatch() to permit giving a list of matrices as
	first argument.  No testing of this new functionality yet, but
	confirmed it still works with older-style calls

2005-04-??
	* Introduced minControlsCap, maxControlsCap
2005-06-01
	* Removed plantdist.rda and instead defined "plantdist" 
	distance matrix in text of examples, in order to work around
	hangup during Windows install

	* Slight modification to zzz.R
